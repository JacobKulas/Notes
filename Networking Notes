TTL of 1 likely means someone is tracerouting you
Linux default ICMP message: 64 bytes
Windows default ICMP message: 40 bytes
Traceroute on linux is UDP (by default)
traceroute -U for UDP
sudo traceroute -I for ICMP
sudo traceroute -T for TCP

Traceroute on Windows is ICMP (by default)

IPv6 doesnt have broadcast, it has anycast
