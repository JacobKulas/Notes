If the more fragment bit is set then it will be followed by more fragmented bits
Offset is on from 2nd until last
offset = ((MTU - (IHL*4)/8)    <- NOT COMPLETE FORMULA 
If a packet has the more frament bit selected and no offset then it is the start of a fragmented stream
TTL of 1 likely means someone is tracerouting you
Linux default ICMP message: 64 bytes
Windows default ICMP message: 40 bytes
Traceroute on linux is UDP (by default)
traceroute -U for UDP
sudo traceroute -I for ICMP
sudo traceroute -T for TCP

Traceroute on Windows is ICMP (by default)

IPv6 doesnt have broadcast, it has anycast

TCP uses segments
UDP uses datagrams
